# Scratchcord Server V2
##### This time not written in scratch!

## What is this?
A friend of mine wrote an app called "[Scratchcord](https://github.com/Ikelene/ScratchCord)", which is more similar to IRC than anything else. I noticed how he was using a library called Cloudlink, on publicly accessble nodes, with a "server" running as a client, where anyone could intercept messages & passwords being sent in **plaintext** for anyone to see! Because of this, I took some pity and decided to write this! It's also a way for me to dip my toes in Go.

## Features
- üîí Any proper security (eg. passwords aren't stored in plaintext)
- üöÄ Fast
- üê≥ Easy to deploy
- üíæ Persistant Message & Account storage
- ...and much more!

## Setup
Setting this up, you can take two paths.

- üñ• Bare metal
- üê≥ Docker

### üê≥ Docker (recommended)
With this I assume you know how docker works. If not, google is your friend :)

At present moment, since this repo is private, you will need to add your github username and Personal Access Token to docker. [Follow this guide on github to authenticate on docker](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

Here is an example docker compose file:
```yml
services:
  scratchcord-server:
    image: ghcr.io/preloading/scratchcord-server-rewritten:main
    environment:
      - SCRATCHCORD_MOTD=Welcome to My New Scratchcord Server!
      - SCRATCHCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/1qax2sdv4rfv5ggb6yhn7ujm8ik
      - SCRATCHCORD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
      - SCRATCHCORD_SERVER_URL=https://example.com/api
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/scratchcord-server-rewritten/sqlite:/config/sqlite'
      - '/path/to/scratchcord-server-rewritten/keys:/config/keys'
      - '/path/to/scratchcord-server-rewritten/uploads:/config/uploads'

```
